## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

What was most challenging was figuring out how to read the file and update it based on the user's answers, but the actual game part (and using the Binary Search Trees) were easier and fun! What was most interesting was having the program learn from its guesses, feels like a dip of a toe in the massive pool of AI and working with other programs that learn. Overall, a fun assignment albeit a hard one.
